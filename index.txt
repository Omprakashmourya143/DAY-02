1.Write a Blog on Difference between HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2.

                                            HTTP 1.1

1.	HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997.
2.	It works on the textual format.
3.	There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources. 
4.	It uses requests resource In-lining for use getting multiple pages.
5.	It compresses data by itself.

                                                   HTTP 2

1.	The new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
2.	It works on the binary protocol.
3.	It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
4.	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
5.	It uses HPACK for data compression.

2.Write a Blog about Objects and Internal Representation in Java-script.

 Objects, in JavaScript, is it most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
